This folder contains legacy model files. The goal is to make these files forward to the canonical models in `src/models` without breaking runtime code.

Planned safe migration steps:
1. Backup each original file to `*.bak.js` in this directory.
2. Replace the original file with a shim that prefers `../src/models/<lowercase>` and falls back to the backup if needed.
3. Run `node ../scripts/check-models.js` and app tests.
4. After verification, gradually update callers to import from `src/models` exclusively and remove backups.

This README is auto-generated by the unification assistant.
